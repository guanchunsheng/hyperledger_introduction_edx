# 3. 商业区块链技术前景
## 3.1 学习目标
- 检验区块链技术应用于解决现实世界商业问题的若干用例
- 发现评估一个项目是否适合使用区块链技术的若干因素
- 决定是否采用区块链技术

## 商业区块链项目概览
区块链是一个新的数据结构，在参与者之间自动的施加信任。共识算法保证所有的参与者对区块链中存储的数据达成一致。区块链为依赖于中央权威的进行确权的行业打开了颠覆之门。它还允许独立甚至处于竞争状态的机构之间在行业中为了提升效率而共享信息。

在permissioned区块链中，若干机构间的共识负责控制参与到区块链的参与方，提供鉴权。在公链中，没有中央权威或者中央管理就可以进行数据交换。区块链可以通过受控制的行业联盟数据共享网络驱动业务创新。

分布式账本技术（DLT）的前景已经被很多行业注意到了，它可以简化和自动化的进行很多关键性的工作。商业中也已经意识到从封闭的解决方案到开源能力的转换能够提升效率，比如超级账本商业区块链技术。随着技术的越发成熟，一些通用的区块链项目特性正在成形。

企业现在如何使用这些新兴技术？下面我们会解释分布式账本技术在实际公司中的现状，以及他们跟传统工具的对比。

Technologists are studying the Hyperledger protocol and applications.
What should business professionals know about the Hyperledger project?
So, business professionals who should... when they see the word 'hyperledger', right,
they should associate that with a set of principles that have to do with the creation of high-quality, trustworthy software, right?
First of all, they should associate it with open source development practices,
they should know that any project that carries the term 'hyperledger', 'hyperledger foobar', 'hyperledger rhubarb', right,
that these are projects that have been collaboratively built,
that have been vetted by multiple developers working in concert on the technology,
that it's as secure as we can make it, because the code is out there.
We try to hire folks to vet it, but we also... fundamentally, you shouldn't trust software that you can't see the source code to, right?
So, that brand association, that trademark should really come to be associated with open source, with security, as well as with a sense of process,
like something that can't just show up one day and become a Hyperledger project.
The Technical Steering Committee has to approve any new proposed submission, and they have a pretty high bar.
Our goal, again, is not to be the GitHub of projects, even in the distributed technology, or distributed ledger, or smart contract space,
but to really have a high quality portfolio of these different efforts.
Finally, they should realize that they can build their business on top of Hyperledger technologies,
they can use it all day long, they don't owe anybody a fee, a license fee, a patent license, nothing,
and, if they feel like it, if they want to contribute, there should be an easy glide path to having their technical teams get deeper into the code,
become contributors, and even help set the direction for the technology.
